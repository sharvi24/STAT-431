Description: Introduction to the concepts and methodology of Bayesian statistics, for students
with fundamental knowledge of mathematical statistics. Topics include Bayesâ€™ rule, prior and
posterior distributions, conjugacy, Bayesian point estimates and intervals, Bayesian hypoth-
esis testing, noninformative priors, practical Markov chain Monte Carlo, hierarchical models
